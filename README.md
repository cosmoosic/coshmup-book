# Coshmup Project Design Document

This is document is there to summarize all design and code choices made during development of as yet untitled Cosmoose shmup (shoot'em up). 
These can be classified as aesthetic, technological choices, gameplay choices, music (and quantization), and maybe annex subjects like community and marketing (lol).

The Cosmoose universe is used as a backdrop for the game, and will be used as much as possible to inform the different design choices, but is not a limit.

Another purpose is to serve as a reference to the shmup tradition that informs the different choices we will make; the purpose is not to be exhaustive (good resources already exist), but to provide a path for anyone towards our conceptual view.

It is hard to really separate concerns in the design of a shmup; aesthetic, programming and music directly impact gameplay, and in general all aspects are inextricably linked.
The organization of this document thus might be changed depending on the impact of each feature during development.
