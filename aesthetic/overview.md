## Aesthetic

While Cosmoose use a chibi anime aesthetic, the goal is to have two version of character assets, one using chibi anime and one using traditional anime.
These two modes would only concern characters, the rest of the assets should (ships, space elements, etc) should work well enough in both cases.
